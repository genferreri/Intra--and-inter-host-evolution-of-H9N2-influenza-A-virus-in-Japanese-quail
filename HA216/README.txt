The analysis for HA 216 (226 in H3 numbering) is done using the script Freq216.sh.
This script requires the fastq files (compressed as fastq.gz), the HA information in fasta 
format and the script Rvar216trunc_v2.R in ~/scripts.
The script was written for the sapelo 2 computer cluster at the University of Georgia.
